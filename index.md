## Me as a Programmer 

 
### Coursework

Throughout my time at UCSD I have had the opportunity to work in a vareity of classes covering a vareity of topics. 

The Computer Science courses I have taken so far are:
* CSE 11 : *Intro to Java Programing*
* CSE 12 : *Basic Data Structures and Object-Oriented Design*
* CSE 15L : *Software Tools and Techniques Laboratory*
* CSE 20 : *Discrete Mathematics*
* CSE 21 : *Mathematics for Algorithms and Systems*
* CSE 30 : *Computer Organization and Systems Programming* 
* CSE 100 : *Advanced Data Structures*
* CSE 105 : *Thoery of Computability*

For those classes I have take I have used a variety of programming lanugages including 
- Java
- C
- C++

### Side Endeavors 
I recently have also began experimenting with a side project over Spring Break.

The project I am dabbling in is a simple user authentication system with a UI using JavaFX for the user Interface functionality.  
I am also using Java's built in security libraries to hash the given passwords to store instead of storing the password directly into a file.

```
    String s = null;
    try
    {
        byte[] hash = getSha(input);
        s =  toHexString(hash);
    }
    catch(NoSuchAlgorithmException e)
    {
        System.out.println("Hashing error wrong Algorithm");
        //String s = null;
    }
    return s;
```

## My Hobbies 

### Ultimate Frisbee

Throughout my time at UCSD I have played on the Men's Ultimate Frisbee team.   
It has been one of the best experiences and I have made so many lifelong friends.   
It also is a great way to keep in shape and is overall really fun and something I look forward too every week.

Also it has come with some pretty funny inside jokes such as: 
> Hydration is not a Joke! -All Air Squids

### Snowboarding

I have been snowboarding since my senior year in highschool. It is a great hobby to be out in natureand it is very relaxing.

Some mountains I have been to are
- Mammoth Mountain, CA
- Bear Mountain, CA
- Big Sky, MT
